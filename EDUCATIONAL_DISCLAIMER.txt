- Pattern recognition
- Statistical analysis

üö´ DO NOT USE FOR:
- Protecting sensitive information
- Securing passwords or personal data
- Any real-world security applications
- Commercial or production systems
- Confidential communications

‚úÖ APPROPRIATE USES:
- Learning cryptography concepts
- Understanding historical encryption methods
- Educational demonstrations
- Programming practice
- Academic coursework
- Puzzle games and entertainment
